# Unit 19: BudgetTracker: Progressive Web Applications

This repository (BudgetTracker) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to help students become more familiar with using progressive web applications or PWA. PWA's are used to help support web applications by allowing the user to install the web page as a mobile application and be able to use that apllication offline. PWA'S have a set criteria to be considered one according to wikepedia "
1. "Originate from a secure origin. Served over TLS and green padlock displays (no active mixed content). Progressive web apps must be served via HTTPS to ensure user privacy, security, and content authenticity.

1. Register a service worker with a fetch handler. Progressive web apps must use service workers to create programmable content caches. Unlike regular HTTP web cache, which caches content after the first use and then relies on various heuristics to guess when content is no longer needed, programmable caches can explicitly prefetch content in advance before it's used for the first time and explicitly discard it when it is no longer needed.[25] This requirement helps pages to be accessible offline or on low quality networks.

2. Reference a web app manifest. The manifest must contain at least the five key properties: name or short_name, start_url, and display (with a value of standalone, fullscreen or minimal-ui), and icons (with 192px and a 512px versions). Due to existence of manifest, PWAs can be easily shared via a URL, discovered by a search engine, and do not require complex installation (but can be listed in a third-party app store).[26] Furthermore, PWAs support native app-style interactions and navigation, including being added to home screen, displaying splashscreens, etc." [1]
